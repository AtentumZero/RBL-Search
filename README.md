# RBL-Search

A basic shell script to check if an IP address is listed on an IP and/or Domain based Blacklist. 

Other than an active Internet connection and Bash or a bash compatible-shell installed, there are no other requirements for RBL-Search to run.

Blacklists can be added, amended or removed by modifying the list of addresses listed in the BLIST and DLIST sections of the script.
